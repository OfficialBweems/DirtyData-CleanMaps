### Notes on data cleaning needed before we can create the map###
#1. import csvs, 3 total
#2. left merge the csvs together?
  # Species <- Transects <- Site_metadata
  # merge the transect info to the species using transect id
  # merge the site meta data using Site name
#3. amalgamate the the fish into abundance by species and and site, should
  # end up with two numbers per site for a total of 86 rows of data
#4. calculate the area of each site based on length and width
#5. calculate density of the two species for each site
#7. map the species and color by density, shape for species ie two shapes/site
#-- spit and map only one species at at time? 
#-- have two maps side by side?
